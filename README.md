# Automatic Dustbin

## Overview
This project is an Automatic Dustbin designed to open its lid automatically when it detects an object near it. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of an object and a servo motor to open and close the lid. This project aims to promote hygiene and convenience.
